## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
+ According to our results, vehicle length, vehicle weight, and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
+ The slope of the linear model is not zero because the p-value of the linear regression (5.35 x 10^-11) is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.
+ With an r-squared value of 0.71, about 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct.  This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of suspension coils must not exceed 100 PSI.  According to the Coil Summary, the total variance across all lots (62.3) is below that threshold.  However, when the Lot Summary is analyzed Lot3 (170.3) is above that threshold.
